# Welcome to Ataraxia Linux

## Introduction
Ataraxia Linux is an independent, multi-platform,  general purpose operating system based on the [Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) and [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org/). Ataraxia Linux aims to be simple, compact and safe, adhering strictly to the KISS principle. It can be used on desktops, servers and embedded devices. Ataraxia Linux is available for x86, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC64 (big and little endian) and RISC-V. It uses it's own package manager called "[neko](https://github.com/ataraxialinux/neko)", which is compatible with [CRUX](https://crux.nu/) Pkgfiles. Ataraxia Linux provides better security than standard distributions. For example, every package was compiled with [PIC, PIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code) and [SSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow_protection) and the kernel is configured for better security, without compromise. Ataraxia Linux is oriented towards advanced Linux users, who know what they're doing.
